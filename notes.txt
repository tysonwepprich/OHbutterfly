notes on dataviz

when new species selected in tab 2, site resets to first alphabetical
map not removing sites that don't have selected species
map not highlighting selected location
clicking on map crashes app, but selected location in input is OK
  if statement in server line 14 is the culprit of the crash
  but now clicking on map doesn't update input location
occupancy colors too light at most bins, can't see sites
scales of index and rawcounts off


1st tab:
error message briefly shows when site changes and year no longer matches up with existing data

both tabs:
how to rename variables for graphs
help buttons freeze rstudio, always grayed out and loading

new tabs:
GAM phenology by site/species/year

climate effects with predictions from my models for each species (with uncertainty!)
slider bars for variable inputs
