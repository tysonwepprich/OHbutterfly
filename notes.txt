notes on dataviz

tab2:
when new species selected in tab 2, site resets to first alphabetical
occupancy legend needed
occupancy colors too light at most bins, can't see sites
scales of index and rawcounts off


tab1:

both tabs:
how to rename variables for graphs
help buttons freeze rstudio, always grayed out and loading
add scientific name to species table so can search by both

new tabs:
GAM phenology by site/species/year

climate effects with predictions from my models for each species (with uncertainty!)
slider bars for variable inputs

or x-y plot of landuse vs climate predictive r2 for differnt species
popup of which seasons important?
